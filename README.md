<p align="center"> The project aims to address the gap in providing accessible and personalized support for individuals seeking to improve their health and well-being. There is a deficiency in the availability of comprehensive knowledge on healthy living and mental health awareness in a single platform. The absence of such an application limits the ability of users to make informed decisions about their well-being. To bridge this gap, our project will focus on developing an Android application that empowers users to access personalized health and well-being recommendations, facilitating informed choices and ultimately promoting a healthier lifestyle and improved mental well-being.
